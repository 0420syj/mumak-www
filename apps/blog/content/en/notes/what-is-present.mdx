# What happened today at work

A colleague received doughnuts as a gift from a friend who happened to be passing by.
There were enough for every team member to have one.

It was a shock for me, as it was something I would never do.
At the same time, I felt a deep respect for that colleague's friend.
Other team members also praised that she had a good friend.

# What is a gift to me?

Until today's incident, giving a gift is not a big deal for me.
I viewed exchanging gifts on anniversaries is just a polite gesture.

But from today, my perception of gift has changed.
It is an expression of affection for a friend, conveyed through action, even on ordinary days.
Anniversaries are occasions to gather and deliver those feelings we've failed to express routinely.

Before the anniversary arrives, I want to be the kind of person who can reflect on the conversations shared and time spent together with that person.
Think "Ah yes, he did like doughnuts", and then give him doughnuts as a gift.
