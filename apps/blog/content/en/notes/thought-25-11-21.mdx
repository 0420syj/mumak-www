Lately, I delegate almost everything to AI. I even forcefully offload trivial tasks.

Small code fixes that would be faster if I did them myself, deciding which book to read next, or even just finding 16 people's names and adding commas between them, etc.

Sometimes, it feels like it's untangling a knot of thread in my head for me. It feels refreshing. But today, something felt off. It felt like the Rummikub game I was enjoying solving just moments ago was snatched away.

The topic was this: "I'm worried because there are too many things I want to do in my free time lately." My idea before asking was to set themes by day of the week—like Monday for gaming, Tuesday for coding, and Wednesday for reading.

And Gemini said:

> _1\. Thematic Days_
>
> _Instead of trying to cram all activities into one day, this method designates a main theme for each day to increase focus._

It was identical to what I thought before asking. The worry in my head felt like it was crushed by something, instantly squashed and scattered.

The worry definitely disappeared, but it felt like it went missing rather than being resolved. Why did I suddenly feel this way? I don't really know.

First off, since it counts as being cross-validated, my worry is resolved, and I'm going to live like that next week. But is it okay to keep living like this? I'm not sure.
