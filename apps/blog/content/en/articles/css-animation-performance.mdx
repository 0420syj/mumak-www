Had a janky progress bar on mobile. Switching from `width` to `transform: scaleX()` fixed it instantly.

## Why the Difference

Understanding the [browser rendering pipeline](/en/garden/browser-rendering-pipeline) gives you the answer.

- `width` change → **Recalculate from Layout** → Main thread blocking
- `transform` change → **Composite only** → GPU handles it

## Real Example

```tsx
// Before - reflow every frame
<div style={{ width: `${progress}%` }} />

// After - GPU-accelerated, no reflow
<div
  className="w-full origin-left will-change-transform"
  style={{ transform: `scaleX(${progress / 100})` }}
/>
```

The difference is dramatic for frequent animations like scroll events.

## Key Takeaway

- `width`, `height` → Layout trigger → Main thread blocking
- `transform`, `opacity` → Composite only → GPU handles it

Mobile has a weaker main thread, so the difference is more noticeable.
