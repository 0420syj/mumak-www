The fact that I can record my thoughts at that very moment. Besides that, there are so many other good points:

- Recording interesting thoughts
- Organizing complex thoughts in my head
- Easily showing others what kind of person I am
- Helping to move things into long-term memory

In many other ways, it fits my personality well.

# However

I looked it up, and the last time I wrote a blog post was two years ago.
Looking back, as always, I exhausted myself trying to build a flawless blog environment, and it just fizzled out.

In the first place, the biggest purpose was to show off that I luckily contributed to Facebook open source.
I probably stopped because I ran out of things to brag about to keep the blog going. Also, I didn't have the peace of mind.

# Fortunately

Recently, I found some breathing room in my life again.
For the past two years, I kept feeling like I wasn't living like myself.
In a way, it was probably because it was the hardest, most difficult, and wandering period of my life.

Anyway, lately I've restarted various things I used to do as a routine, and naturally, the blog came to mind again.
One of my small long-cherished projects. An awesome dev environment (repo), a blog, and a digital garden.

Since I've done the blog, now only the digital garden is left.
But honestly, I can't dare to start that yet.

# Why I chose hashnode

### Why I initially chose hashnode

The reason is simple. An outstanding developer uses it, so I use it too.

Actually, that was the primary reason, but looking into it, I chose it because I saw many developer-friendly elements.
I haven't read all the official documentation, but just a quick look gives that vibe. It's a great feeling.

### Why I chose custom development now (2025-12-06)

The biggest reason was due to an unexplained post deletion issue.

I still don't know the cause, but there was an issue where the posts I wrote were getting deleted.
The slug was reset to the root path.

There was even a time when a post I was writing hard on the bus was completely lost.
I was so angry that I built this blog on a whim.

Thanks, Hashnode.

# Moving forward

I intend to write freely.

- Like a diary

- Sometimes as study notes

- And other times for showing off!
  - I hope there will be a lot of this. I think it will be a good driving force when blogging feels bothersome.
