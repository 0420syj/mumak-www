Zettelkasten is German for "slip box" or "note box".

## Origin

A method used by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. He wrote 70 books and over 400 academic papers using this system.

## Core Principles

1. **Atomic notes** - One idea per note
2. **Unique identifiers** - Assign a number or ID to each note
3. **Links** - Connect notes to each other. This is the key
4. **Own words** - Write in your own language, not quotes

## Why It Works

When small notes connect, new ideas emerge. It's network thinking rather than linear thinking.
