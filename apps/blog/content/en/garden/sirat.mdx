A 2025 film by director Oliver Laxe. A spiritual odyssey that combines the harsh environment of the desert with intense techno music.

## Key Themes

- **Music**: Hard techno by Kangding Ray. There's a peculiar sense of immersion that helps boost focus during development work.
- **Loss and transcendence**: After the shocking death of his son, the protagonist loses the ego-driven purpose of 'finding his daughter' and faces the desert as a pure being — a deeply striking process.
- **Self vs. ego**: A meditation on the essential being that remains when social roles (father) collapse.

## Summary

A journey that continues even after purpose has vanished. The relentless rhythm of techno paradoxically reveals the will to live.
