Principles I follow while running my [[what-is-digital-garden|digital garden]].

## 1. Start Over Perfection

- Plant even rough drafts
- It's okay to publish as a seedling
- Embarrassment is proof of growth

## 2. Be Mindful of Connections

- Look for links to existing notes when writing new ones
- Isolated notes lose value

## 3. Tend Regularly

- Occasionally stop by and refine notes
- Upgrade status as ideas mature
- Fix wrong ideas but leave traces

## 4. Write for Myself

- Primarily a record for my future self
- If others find it useful, that's a bonus
