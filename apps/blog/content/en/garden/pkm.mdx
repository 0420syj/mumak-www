PKM stands for **Personal Knowledge Management**.

## Core Idea

- Collect information
- Organize it
- Connect it
- Retrieve it when needed

If you keep things only in your head, you'll forget. Storing in an external system reduces mental load and lets you find things when needed.

There are many tools like Notion, Obsidian, Roam. But changing tools won't help without the habit. Consistent recording is key.
