A digital garden is a **collection of notes that grows publicly**.

## How It Differs from a Blog

Blogs list finished posts in chronological order. A digital garden, on the other hand:

- **Embraces incompleteness** - Ideas aren't perfect from the start
- **Prioritizes connections over time** - Notes are linked to each other
- **Keeps evolving** - Growth matters more than publish date

## Growth Stages

Notes grow through three stages:

- 🌱 **Seedling** - A freshly planted seed. The starting point of an idea
- 🌿 **Budding** - Growing. Somewhat organized
- 🌳 **Evergreen** - A fully refined thought

## Not Just Big Ideas

A digital garden isn't only for grand thoughts. It's also a **personal vault**:

- Good restaurants
- Places to revisit
- Useful tools and apps
- Memorable quotes

Small things recorded now can connect later. A restaurant note leads to travel plans, a tool note influences how you work.

## Why a Garden

A gardener tends a little each day. No one builds a perfect garden at once. Writing is the same.
