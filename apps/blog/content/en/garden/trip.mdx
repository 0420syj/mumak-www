My travel lies somewhere between a 'Trip' and a 'Tour'—it is closer to a light deviation.

The liberation of escaping the gravity of duty and the daily grind that weighs me down all week, and simply breathing in unfamiliar air.
For me, that alone is enough.

I will be preparing for my trip to [[kagoshima|Kagoshima]] in March.
I will be updating this note as I prepare.
